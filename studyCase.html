            <h2 class="titleC">Problem Statement</h2>
                <p class="textC">

                    DSRL camera skills were taught during the term, and because of this students were required to take photos with aperture and shutter speed mode according to their chosen topic.</p>

            <h2 class="titleC1">Solution</h2>
                <p class="textC1">Students were requested to take photos of an accessible environment. I chose a popular and spontaneous environment as it is for street photography, most likely focusing on architecture. One addtional task was assign to improve the shooting, photos should be edited in photoshop or lightroom, through color correction, croping, and resizing. </p>
